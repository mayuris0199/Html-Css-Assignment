          <p>
            As fundamental web development languages HTML and CSS are a great way to get started with development.
            In fact, HTML uses a tag-based structure which is easy to understand even without any prior technical experience, 
            CSS uses a simplistic structure as well making the learning curve for mastery relatively easy.
            Hence i would like to learn that all stuff and to get more knowledge in HTML and CSS as much as possible.
